# Made to fuck around my school's api

YES I WRITE SHITTY CODE SO WHAT

<!-- ### If you are a staff or an intern at my school head office. Good for you -->

### [main.py](main.py)
Sends POST request to sign up with numbers from **000000000** to **999999999** (9 digits number)

this is possible thanks to them not having checks by having api access to phone provider or doing a SMS code verification. and also for not having students to input their ID card number when registering an account.
